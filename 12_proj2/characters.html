<h2>Michael Gary Scott</h2>
<hr/>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          Michael Gary Scott was born March 15, 1964 in Scranton, Pennsylvania. He
          came from a relatively difficult childhood of loneliness. In "Diversity Day",
          Michael claims to be of English, Irish, German and Scottish ancestry. He also
          claims to be two-fifteenths Native American. He has mentioned a stepfather, Jeff,
          whom he despises. In "Nepotism", it is revealed that Michael had a half-sister,
          from whom he was estranged for 15 years. </p>


        <h3>Interests</h3>

        <p>
          Michael's catchphrase is "That's what she said!", he
          uses it in inappropriate circumstances, including business meetings and legal depositions.
        </p>
        <p>
          He has diverse interests in media. Song parody writing is often referred to. He hopes to finish
          the video production of his script, "Threat Level: Midnight", whose script was found and read by
          the office and whose finished movie (after ten years of production) was viewed in the seventh-season
          episode of the same name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other interests include a pair of Levi's he refers to as "fun jeans", which he has professionally
           dry cleaned and the reason he started Casual Fridays; his self-bought "World's Best Boss" mug from
           Spencer Gifts; and Chrysler automobiles. Michael enjoys
            planning fantasy entrepreneurial schemes that he would like to start, such as a men's shoe store called
            "Shoe La La", or another paper company simply called "Michael".
        </p>

        <h3>Personality and Managment Style</h3>

        <p>
        Apart from his masterful salesmanship, Michael is lacking in almost any other skills,
         management or otherwise. Jim Halpert once made a color graph of how Michael spends his time:
         80% distracting others; 19% procrastination; and 1% critical thinking.  His laid-back
         approach more often results in lower than expected workplace productivity.
        </p>

        <h3>Relationships</h3>

        <p>
          Michael tends to overestimate his importance to his employees, but despite constantly offending some of them,
         he has a close bond with them. Most of the employees have been the focus of Michael's jokes at one point or
         another, usually in reference to their race, sex, size, attractiveness, or sexual orientation.
       </p>
       <p>
         Examples of
         Michael's difficult relationship with his staff include getting slapped by Kelly for being racist, hitting
         Meredith with his car, getting kicked out of Phyllis and Bob's wedding, and outing Oscar to the entire office
         without his permission. They are, however, generally sympathetic to his shortcomings and, while regularly
         losing patience when he interrupts their workflow, often try to assist him with his personal problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          He's very close with his Assistant to the Regional Manager, Dwight Schrute, along with employees Jim and
          Pam Halpert. He is married to Holly Flax. He hates Toby Flenderson.

        <h2>Dwight Kurt Schrute III</h2>
          <hr/>
        <h3>
          Background
        </h3>
        <p>
          Dwight Kurt Schrute III was born January 20, 1968. He is one of the
          highest-ranking salesmen as well as assistant to the regional manager for most of his tenure at Dunder Mifflin.
          Additionally, he is a
          bed-and-breakfast proprietor at Schrute Farms, a beet plantation owner,
          and an owner of the business park in which Dunder Mifflin exists.
        </p>
        <p>
          He is
          notorious for his lack of social skills and common sense, his love for
          martial arts and the justice system, and his office rivalry with fellow
          salesman Jim Halpert. He is also known for his romantic relationship with
           Angela. He has at times risen to the position of acting Branch Manager
           of the Scranton branch, but often serves as a second or third in command
           as Assistant to the Regional Manager.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Interests
        </h3>
        <p>
          Dwight is trained in the art of surveillance, and is a former Lackawanna County
          volunteer sheriff's deputy. He has a purple belt in Goju-Ryu karate.
          He enjoys, and is skilled at, playing table tennis, and states
          that many of his heroes are table tennis players.
        </p>
        <p>
          His musical tastes vary, but heavy metal and classic rock seem to be a recurring theme.
          His personal musical talents are not lacking, as he plays guitar and recorder, and
          sings, as well.
          </p>


        <h3>
          Relationships
        </h3>

        <p>
          <strong>WITH ANGELA:</strong> Towards the middle of season 2, Dwight develops a secret relationship with
           Angela Martin. Later on, Angela asks Dwight to care for her sick cat, Sprinkles. Instead of caring
           for the feline, Dwight kills it as it is a waste of resources, and then tells
           Angela Sprinkles was dead when he arrived. When he lets the truth slip out shortly
           after, Angela terminates their relationship.
             </p>
           <p>
             In the fourth season finale, Dwight is obviously hurt when Angela's new boyfriend,
              Andy, proposes to her. Dwight and Angela have start a covert relationship, meanwhile
              Andy and Angela set a date for their
              wedding. When Andy learns about Angela's affair
              with Dwight, a duel between Dwight and Andy takes place, but both realize that Angela has been
              lying to them both, and they break up with her. For quite some time afterwards, Dwight and Angela avoid
              each other.
           </p>
           <p>
             In the season 6 episode "The Delivery", Dwight decides that he wants a child, and asks Angela to be
              the mother. They sign an
              elaborate contract. While Angela is excited by the reconciliation, Dwight doesn't
              share her romantic feelings. When Dwight develops an interest in another woman, he tells
              Angela to forget about the contract; this infuriates Angela and she sues him in small-claims
              court. Dwight cuts a deal with Angela for five sessions of sex. Which comes to an end when she meets and marries
              a state senator
           </p>
           <p>
             In "Jury Duty", it is revealed that, a month before her wedding to the state senator, Robert Lipton,
             Dwight and Angela had sex, as Robert was not fulfilling Angela's sexual needs, so Dwight believes
             that he is the baby's biological father. In "New Guys", it is revealed that he is not the father.

              In season 9, they become close again when Dwight finds out that Robert is cheating on Angela
              with Oscar. When Dwight seems to be getting
               serious with a neighboring farmer, Esther, and the Senator has publicly dumped Angela, Angela
               breaks down and admits
               to Oscar Martinez that she still loves Dwight. On the day that he intends to ask Esther to
               marry him, Dwight instead proposes to Angela. She says yes, finally admitting that he is the
               father of her son Phillip. They get marriedin the series finale.
                 </p>


                 <strong>WITH JIM AND PAM:</strong> Dwight is frequently the victim of practical jokes by co-workers
                 Jim Halpert and Pam Beesley-Halpert, including putting his desk supplies in the snack machine, putting his stapler
                 into jello, and moving his desk into the men's restroom, although it appears that he remains
                  oblivious to Pam's involvement; these pranks tend to exploit his stubborn and gullible nature.
                  Dwight's frustration with Jim's pranks reaches a crisis point in "Conflict Resolution", when
                  Dwight threatens to quit unless Jim is transferred. Dwight occasionally pulls successful pranks
                  on Jim in turn, most prominently in "Classy Christmas" where he subjects Jim to a barrage of
                  pranks revolving around snowballs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Dwight's relationship with Jim mellows somewhat in later seasons, and they, at times,
                    cooperate effectively on sales calls or running the office in Michael's absence,
                    sometimes even socializing together. Jim often supports Dwight when he is genuinely
                    hurt or in danger and occasionally compliments his successes. However, when Jim is
                    promoted to co-manager, Dwight's enmity returns to full force, and he conducts
                    an ongoing campaign to depose Jim, who eventually resumes his old job as sales
                     representative.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dwight and Pam briefly become best friends while he suffers a concussion in "The Injury". In the
                        season 6 episode "The Delivery", Dwight shows more signs of his begrudging friendship
                        with Jim and Pam during Pam's pregnancy. In the episode, he is sent to the Halperts'
                        house to retrieve Pam's iPod, while they are at the hospital. Instead of finding the
                        iPod and bringing it back to her, Dwight completely rebuilds and repaints their kitchen,
                        after discovering mold.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In the final episode of the series, "Finale", Dwight asks Jim to be the best man at his wedding.
                      Jim throws Dwight a commendable bachelor party rife with surprises (which Jim refers to as
                      "pranks"). Later in the episode Dwight refers to Pam as his "best friend" and as Jim and Pam
                      tell Dwight they are quitting, Dwight fires them instead so he can give them severance
                      packages.

        <h2>James Duncan Halpert</h2>
          <hr/>
        <h3>
          Background
         </h3>
         <p>
            Jim Halpert was born on October 1, 1978, to Gerald and Betsy Halpert. He
            has two brothers, Pete and Tom, who share his general love of pranks but h
            ave come across as unpleasant and somewhat bullying towards their little
            brother. Jim's parents presumably live in Scranton as well, as well as his
            sister Larissa and best friend Alan Murphy, who are listed as his emergency
            contacts at Dunder Mifflin.  He attended the University of Scranton. Jim
            began working at Dunder Mifflin between 1998 and 1999.
         </p>
        <h3>
          Interests
        </h3>
        <p>
          Jim is a fan of the Philadelphia Phillies, Philadelphia Eagles and the
          Philadelphia 76ers. Jim appears to be a fan of hip-hop, specifically
          Eminem as Pam mentions him listening to the 8 Mile soundtrack on his iPod in
          "The Delivery". He also appears to like alternative rock, soft rock, and
          the band KISS. Though Jim loves to play pranks on Dwight, he is shown to
          have some things in common with his nemesis, such as a knowledge of comic
           books and an appreciation for the sci-fi/fantasy genre.
        </p>


        <h3>
          Realtionship with Pam
      </h3>
      <p>
        Jim's relationship with Pam Beesly is often the subject of office speculation.
        This is made worse by the fact that Pam was engaged to Roy Anderson, a
        Dunder Mifflin warehouse worker. Throughout the first two seasons,
        incidents such as Pam falling asleep on Jim's shoulder and drunkenly kissing
         him show a possibility of the feelings being mutual; however, Pam never
         acts on them and she remains engaged to Roy.
         </p>

         <p>
        In the season 2 finale, "Casino Night",
        he confesses his love for Pam. Pam, whose wedding to Roy was planned out
        and just weeks away, clearly shows her anguish but gently turns him down.
       Jim tearfully walks away, later kisses her in the office, and the season ends.
        In the third season premiere it is revealed that he
        transfered to Stamford despite the fact that Pam has called off her wedding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jim's unresolved feelings toward Pam starts to affect his new relationship with
        salesperson Karen when they both move to Scranton after the two branches merge. During a company outing
        at the beach, Pam confesses to Jim in front of everyone that he was the
        reason she broke off her wedding to Roy. However, Jim's relationship with Karen and
        pending interview for a corporate position which would require his
        relocation to New York City, still obstruct a potential romance.
      </p>
      <p>
        In "The Job", Jim, Karen, and Michael each interview for the corporate
        position. During the interview, he notices a caring note from Pam in his
        briefcase. After the interview he drives back to Scranton, leaving Karen
       broken-hearted in NYC. While Pam is describing her lack
       of satisfaction with her relationship with Jim. Jim
       suddenly interrupts the session to ask her to dinner. She becomes overjoyed,
       and accepts the invitation. They begin dating
        shortly after.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jim proposes during a rainy last minute lunch date at an Interstate rest stop
         between Scranton and New York City, where Pam is attending Pratt. Later on, during a
         company picnic, Pam injures
         her ankle during a volleyball game and Jim takes her to the hospital. The
         camera crew is stationed outside an exam room while a doctor updates Jim and
         Pam on her condition.  It is heavily implied that Pam is pregnant, and the pregnancy
         is confirmed in Season 6.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jim and Pam marry in the highly anticipated, hour-long episode, "Niagara".
        When their guests' craziness threatens to ruin the wedding day, they run off a
        nd are privately married on the "Maid of the Mist" before returning to take part
        in their planned church wedding. Their daughter, Cecelia Marie Halpert
        is born in another hour-long episode several months later, in "The Delivery".
        Early in season 8, it is revealed that Jim will be a father for the second time
        as Pam is expecting a son, which they name Phillip.

        <p>
          Pam is initially the receptionist at the paper distribution company
          Dunder Mifflin, before becoming a saleswoman and eventually office
           administrator until she left in the series finale. Her character is
          shy, growing assertive but amiable, and artistically inclined. At the
          beginning of the series, Pam has been dating Roy for eight years
          and engaged for three years. Their open-ended engagement has become
          one of Michael's running gags and a sore spot for Pam. Pam calls off her
          wedding to Roy after Jim confesses his feelings to her.
          She later shares romantic interest with Jim Halpert, whom she begins dating in
          the fourth season and marries and starts a family with as the series continues.
