      The Office is an American television sitcom that aired on NBC from March 24, 2005,
      to May 16, 2013, lasting nine seasons. It is an adaptation of the original BBC
      series of the same name and was adapted for American television by Greg Daniels,
      a veteran writer for Saturday Night Live, King of the Hill, and The Simpsons. It
      was co-produced by Daniels's Deedle-Dee Productions, and Reveille Productions (later
      Shine America), in association with Universal Television. The original executive
      producers were Greg Daniels, Howard Klein, Ben Silverman, Ricky Gervais, and Stephen
      Merchant, with numerous others being promoted in later seasons.

      The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania,
      branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. To simulate the look of an actual
      documentary, it was filmed in a single-camera setup, without a studio audience or a
      laugh track. The series debuted on NBC as a midseason replacement and aired 201 episodes
      over the course of its run.

      The Office initially featured Steve Carell, Rainn Wilson, John
      Krasinski, Jenna Fischer, and B. J. Novak as the main cast; the series experienced numerous
      changes to its ensemble cast during its run. Notable stars outside the original main cast
      include Ed Helms, Mindy Kaling, and Ellie Kemper.

      The Office was met with varied reviews during its first season, but the following four seasons
      received widespread acclaim from television critics. These seasons were included on several
      critics' year-end top TV series lists, winning several awards such as a Peabody Award in 2006,
      two Screen Actors Guild Awards, a Golden Globe Award for Carell's performance, and four
      Primetime Emmy Awards, including one for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2006. Later seasons
      were criticized for a decline in quality, with many seeing Carell's departure in season seven
      as a contributing factor. However, earlier writers oversaw the final season and ended
      the series' run with a positive reception. The series finale was viewed by an estimated 5.69
      million viewers, preceded by an hour-long series retrospective.
